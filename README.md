# Snake-Game-in-python
As a Python beginner, I made this Snake Game to learn coding and game development. It showcases my Python skills. The game is a classic experience where players control a snake to eat food and grow without hitting obstacles.

Snake Game
Welcome to the Snake Game!
Hey there! Welcome to my Snake Game project!This is a fun little game I created using Python and the Turtle graphics library. It's inspired by the classic Snake game we all know and love!

How to Play
Playing the game is super easy! Just follow these simple steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
Download or clone this repository to your computer.
Open the folder and run the snake_game.py file.
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake around the screen.
Try to eat as much food as you can to make the snake grow longer! But be careful not to run into the walls or yourself, or it's game over!
Getting Started
If you're new to Python or programming in general, don't worry! This project was created by a fellow beginner just like you. It's a great way to learn and practice your coding skills while having fun!

Contributing
I'm always open to feedback and suggestions for improving the game. If you have any ideas or want to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
